# Active Context

## Current Task
- Make the generated document behave like an A4 page and refine table/certification layout to match the provided sample.

## Done Last Session
- Initialized `.agents/` context files for this repository.
- Added `.impeccable.md` with inferred frontend design context for this internal tool.
- Split `iphone_receipt_webapp.jsx` into entry component, receipt components, constants, and utility modules.
- Added a runnable Vite + React + Tailwind setup with local UI primitives and alias config.
- Installed dependencies and verified production build passes.
- Moved PDF/export dependencies to lazy loading and added a download loading state.
- Added inline form validation and amount sanitization/formatting for receipt rows.
- Added free deployment scripts and a Cloudflare Pages deployment guide.
- Committed and pushed the project to `origin/main`.
- Updated the name selectors to default to `เลือกชื่อ` with preview fallbacks.
- Updated receipt dates to default to the current day for the initial row and new rows.
- Updated the initial description/amount fields to start empty with the requested placeholders.
- Removed the floating total badge above the preview card.
- Shortened the amount field label from `จำนวนเงินแต่ละรายการ` to `จำนวนเงิน`.
- Added a dedicated signing-date input defaulting to today and wired the preview signature date to it.
- Changed the item-entry flow to use a resettable draft form: add item to preview only after pressing `เพิ่มรายการ`.
- Replaced the iPhone-style preview shell with a full-page PDF document preview.
- Moved the document logo to the right side of the PDF header.
- Adapted the form and PDF preview layout for easier phone use with tighter spacing and touch-friendly controls.
- Updated the UI theme to match the logo direction with warm cream surfaces and soft `umore` blue accents.
- Fixed the download flow so a valid draft item can be exported immediately without forcing the user to press `เพิ่มรายการ` first.
- Moved the `Download PDF` button from the form panel to the top-right area of the PDF preview.
- Fixed the PDF export error from `html2canvas` by cloning the preview and inlining computed styles before rendering.
- Hardened the PDF export fix by stripping classes from the export clone and normalizing `oklch` / `color-mix` values before capture.
- Isolated PDF export into a blank offscreen `iframe` so `html2canvas` no longer sees the app stylesheet during capture.
- Stopped copying custom CSS variables and unresolved modern color values into the export clone to avoid `html2canvas` parsing `oklch(...)`.
- Expanded `jsconfig.json` with Vite-friendly module resolution and explicit includes to reduce IDE false-positive red errors.
- Replaced the preview logo block with explicit inline brand colors and changed PDF filenames to numeric timestamps.
- Added the provided `umore made` PNG as a real asset and wired the PDF preview to render it directly.
- Reworked the PDF table into a fixed-height reserved area with vertically stacked entries, enlarged the logo, and changed the certification line to a document-style name pattern.
- Set the PDF preview canvas to A4 dimensions, reduced table typography to 12pt, constrained column widths with `table-fixed`, and split the certification text into the requested pattern.
- Added a first-line indent to the certification text and changed the owner-name underline to a dotted line.

## Next Steps
- If needed, commit and push the latest PDF layout refinements.
- Validate the exported PDF against the live preview after the next deploy finishes.
